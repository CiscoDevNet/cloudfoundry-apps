# ASP.NET Core getting started application
The IBM Cloud Getting started tutorial for ASP.NET Core uses this sample application to provide you with a sample workflow for working with any .NET Core app on IBM Cloud; you set up a development environment, deploy an app locally and on IBM Cloud, and integrate a IBM Cloud database service in your app.

The ASP.NET Core getting started application uses a [ClearDB MySQL service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cleardb-managed-mysql-database) from IBM Cloud to add information to a database and then return information from a database to the UI.

The user enters the name, Mary and the screen refreshes to display, Hello, Mary, I've added you to the database. The database contents listed are now Mary, Joe, Jane, and Bob.">

The following steps are the general procedure to set up and deploy your app. See more detailed instructions in the [Getting started tutorial for ASP.NET Core](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/dotnet/getting-started.html#getting_started).
